Dogecoin increased in value after the Tesla (TSLA) boss tweeted: \"High time I confessed I let the Doge out\". Read more: Crypto live prices The tweet saw dogecoin\\'s value spike 0.1%, a 2.8% rise in the past week, as the rest of the cryptocurrency market turned red. Before Musk\\'s tweet, dogecoin was down 3% on the day, trading at $0.082. But since his cryptic message the memecoin rose to $0.086. In comparison, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has fallen from its early week high of above $25,000 to $24,170, a drop of 2% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH-USD) also fell 2% in the past day, to $1,646, as of the time of writing. On Wednesday, the global cryptocurrency market cap stood at $1.15tn, down 2.0% in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coingecko. The crypto markets tend to mirror US equities. On Tuesday, US stocks tumbled as the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates and letdowns from big-box retailers dampened the mood on Wall Street. Tuesday saw the worst day yet for US markets in 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 82 points, or 2%, to close at 3,997, its sharpest drop since the market was selling off in December.

Last week, he shared a photo of his Shiba Inu dog seated in a large armchair behind a desk, with a comment saying: “The new CEO of Twitter is amazing\". The iconic dogecoin dog is a Shiba Inu breed. Last week\\'s tweet also pushed up the price of dogecoin. Speculation now abounds over whether Musk will allow dogecoin to be used for tipping and micro-payments on',\n",
              "  'Elon Musk posted in a thread on Twitter last year, after inflation hit a 40-year high for the first time, advising followers to own “physical things” when inflation is high. In the tweet, Musk said “As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high. I still own & won’t sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw.” The biggest takeaway for some followers seems to have been that Musk is still holding his Dogecoin because the cryptocurrency’s price saw a temporary spike shortly after the tweet. However, the more important point to Musk’s message is that physical assets are generally the safest investment during times of high inflation. This message coming from the “Dogefather” himself should speak volumes. While inflation is finally starting to cool off in the U.S., it still remains fairly high with the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) data coming in at 6.4% year-over-year. This means Musk’s advice to own physical things is still just as relevant today as it was a year ago. Here are three that have historically performed well during periods of high inflation. While Musk referenced owning a home, real estate, in general, performs well for investors during years of high inflation. Specifically, single-family homes and multifamily properties. Regardless of the fluctuation in values, these assets can provide consistent cash flow through all economic environments. Running out to buy a property may not be the most feasible option for most investors right now, but luckily there are options available to buy shares of fractionalized real estate. Investors can buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, or invest in multifamily and commercial real estate in some of the fastest-growing cities in the country.

              "  \"One tweet from Elon Musk can move markets, and on Tuesday night, the Tesla CEO and embattled owner of Twitter pushed up the price of canine-themed cryptocurrencies with just a photo of his dog. “The new CEO of Twitter is amazing,” gushed Musk, as his dog, dressed in an iconic Silicon Valley-style black turtleneck, sat authoritatively in a large armchair behind a desk. Shortly afterward, the prices of cryptocurrencies Dogecoin, Floki, and Shiba Inu, all of which are named after dogs, soared. The gains illustrate Musk’s capacity to mint money with just a few trigger-happy taps of his thumbs as well as his focus on his Twitter persona, after he reportedly ordered 80 Twitter engineers to boost his engagement during the Super Bowl. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1625696076127936512 Dogecoin—arguably the first “memecoin,” or cryptocurrency created specifically as a joke—jumped more than 5% in approximately 15 minutes. The token’s market cap increased by almost $500 million, reaching more than $11.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Floki, a memecoin originally named after Elon Musk's dog, also rose precipitously. The price of an individual token increased by almost 50% in about an hour, as its total market cap soared by half. And Shiba Inu, another dog-themed memecoin named after the breed of Musk’s dog, also saw a price jump, rising more than 1.5% within the first 15 minutes of Musk’s post. Musk also tweeted a photo of his dog wearing glasses, a suit, and a tie. “So much better than the other guy,” he wrote, perhaps referencing himself, a CEO who has cut the majority of Twitter’s workforce since taking the company private in October. Musk said in December he would resign as Twitter’s CEO after he polled his more than 100 million followers about whether he should stay on as “Chief Twit,” and the majority of voters preferred that he step down. Musk moving markets with tweets is not a new phenomenon. In 2021, he posted that Tesla was making “merch buyable with Doge,” and Dogecoin surged in response. Three years before that, Musk tweeted that he “was considering taking Tesla private.” The “funding was secured,” he\",\n",

Cryptocurrency Business Progress BIT Mining has four primary business segments covering self-mining, mining pool, data center operation and mining machine manufacturing. The Company is pursuing its development strategy to focus on cryptocurrency mining operations globally. Our subsidiary, Bee Computing, has designed a new generation of highly efficient Bitcoin (\"BTC\") and Dogecoin (\"DOGE\") / Litecoin (\"LTC\") mining machines utilizing the most advanced technology. Together with our partners, we have successfully produced more than 5,000 DOGE/LTC mining machines with a total hash rate capacity of approximately 22,373 GH/s. We have deployed all of these DOGE/LTC mining machines at our Ohio data center for use in our self-mining business. We expect to have produced approximately 8,000 DOGE/LTC mining machines in aggregate by early April 2023. Our BTC mining ASIC has been taped out and is in the process of being fine-tuned and optimized. The first silicon engineering sample of the chips will be available by the end of February 2023. We expect to have the first batch of system engineering samples in the first half of 2023. Bee Computing successfully produced 252 W1 ASIC Ethereum Classic (\"ETC\") mining machines in August 2022, achieving power efficiency of 0.5 W/MH. These ETC mining machines have been deployed and are online at the cryptocurrency mining data center we host in Akron, Ohio (the \"Ohio Mining Site\"). As of today, a substation with power capacity of 82.5 megawatts has completed construction and is operational at the Ohio Mining Site. The Ethereum Merge, namely, of the Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain Proof-of-Stake system (the \"Merge\"), occurred on September 15, 2022. After the Merge, the Company changed its strategy to ETC cryptocurrency mining operations. As of today, the total hash rate capacity of our online ETC mining machines is approximately 3,525 GH/s. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we produced 35,936 ETC',\n",

Secure your seat today Kraken's settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its liquid staking platform spurred a market decline, with the impact felt most by futures traders betting on further growth. Long trades, or bets on higher prices, took 90% of the $220 million in liquidations on crypto futures trading over the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) fell nearly 5%. Bitcoin and ether futures cumulatively saw $100 million in liquidations, while futures tracking dogecoin (DOGE), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and aptos (APT) took on $4 million in liquidations apiece. That's the highest level of liquidations since last November for long traders, or those who hold the security directly. Crypto exchange Binance took over $95 million in liquidations, the most among counterparties, with OKX seeing $47 million. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position owing to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open. Liquidations data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility. Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.

Secure your seat today PleasrHouse, a \"live auction experiment\" by PleasrDAO, kicked off the new project with a piece from whistleblowers (in different decades) Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg.  Now PleasrDAO is back with a second live auction, and the item for sale is the very couch the meme-famous Shibu Inu, Kabosu, sat on in the picture that spawned a million doge memes. The item is close to PleasrDAO’s heart. The group made news in 2021 for purchasing the popular Doge NFT for $5.5 million and then selling fractional non-fungible token shares of the famous photo. This sale led to the foundation of the Own The Doge Community, which has encouraged donations to animal and children\\'s charities. The second live auction event will start streaming on February 8 at 7:30 p.m. ET with guests Kabosu and his rescuer and photographer, Atsuko Sato. Fans of Kabosu will be able to ask questions during the broadcast by participating in polls and chats on PleasrHouse. This rare appearance by Kabuso follows sad news the 17-year old dog has diagnosed with leukemia. The 24-hour auction for the couch will officially start at 8:30 p.m. ET and is being held to raise money for a good cause. The charity chosen by Atsuko and the Own The Doge community, Save The Children, will receive the proceeds from the sale of the couch.

I wish I could be there this year, but I’m still recovering from a pretty intense four months of making cool things and exposing bad guys. Fortunately, plenty of people are sharing clips from the event, so I can enjoy it vicariously. Unfortunately, many of these posts express something between innocent confusion and sneering takedowns of the supposedly lame ETHDenver goings-on. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. But that attitude, to paraphrase the fugitive philosopher-thief Do Kwon, is a great formula for getting rekt. It may look like silliness and disorganization to you, but ETHDenver’s rough edges are actually strong signals that a real community has been drawn together by shared interests to build something together from the ground up. That’s the kind of community that has and will weather slow periods of crypto growth like what we’re going through right now. Low key, it’s also a signal that a lot of these people are far too rich to give a damn what you think.

              "  'Just a few months after the enormous upgrade called the Merge — the full transition to proof of stake (PoS) from proof of work (PoW) — Ethereum is slated to undergo another major one, the so-called Shanghai upgrade, within a few weeks. The Future of Finances: Gen Z & How They Relate to Money  Advice: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 Simply put, the Shanghai upgrade — or fork — will implement a series of improvement proposals to the main Ethereum chain, several of which upgrade the technical capacity of the chain and lay the groundwork for future scalability, said Lex Sokolin, chief cryptoeconomics officer at ConsenSys. We take a look at how this upgrade will affect Ethereum and its stakeholders. Sokolin explained that the most talked about change is the ability to withdraw staked Ether. Staking means depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software — the cost of that was $52,763 as of Feb. 22. Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your Investments “This staked ether then acts as collateral that can be destroyed if the validator behaves dishonestly or lazily,” the Ethereum Foundation explains. “The validator is then responsible for checking that new blocks propagated over the network are valid and occasionally creating and propagating new blocks themselves.” So, when Ethereum switched to PoS, miners became validators and were able to earn a rate of return denominated in ETH in exchange for locking up their capital. “That lock-up was one way, meaning that they could not withdraw their money back,” Sokolin said. “Such illiquidity is a particular type of risk and explains why staking within Ethereum is below 20%, whereas on other PoS chains staking can reach 80% or more of circulating supply. We think that by unlocking the assets, staking will be de-risked and available to more types of participants.” At the same time, Sokolin added, the newly withdrawn asset will create additional supply on the market, potentially creating pressure. “However, in the long run, we would expect a greater portion of all Ethereum users to avail themselves to the staking returns',\n",

              "  'Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today The next major catalyst for the crypto market is Ethereum\\'s Shanghai upgrade scheduled in March, which will open up withdrawals of more than 16.5 million ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain. The impending upgrade comes months after the Ethereum blockchain underwent a technological overhaul, dubbed the Merge, switching to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work setting. Traders might remember that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, did not see much volatility after the Merge took place on Sept. 15 and conclude that the upcoming upgrade will be a non-event. However, such conclusions may prove inaccurate, according to OrBit Markets, an institutional liquidity provider in digital assets options. \"This time could be different though. While the Merge was a pure technological shift with no direct economic impact, the Shanghai upgrade will change the supply and demand of ETH both in the short term and long term, and therefore capable of having a significant impact on the ETH price,\" Yang Zhiming, co-founder of OrBit Market and former head of currency derivatives for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank, told CoinDesk. The Merge, as the name suggests, combined Ethereum\\'s then-proof-of-work blockchain with the proof-of-stake Beacon chain. While the pivotal upgrade made Ethereum more environmentally friendly and put ether on the path to becoming a deflationary currency, there was no immediate impact on the supply-demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency. Ether\\'s price dropped 10% to $1,472 on the day of the Merge but volatility quickly faded, with prices trading in a narrow range of $1,300 to $1,400 during the following four weeks. Ether\\'s 30-day realized volatility fell from an annualized 85% to nearly 60% in the four weeks following the Merge, according to data sourced from Amberdata. Realized volatility is a backward-looking metric measuring the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period in the past. The upcoming Shanghai upgrade could affect the demand-supply balance in the ether market right away, keeping the cryptocurrency more volatile than it was in weeks after the Merge. \"Some $25 billion worth of ETH',\n",
              "  \"Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which will allow withdrawals for some $29 billion of staked ether (ETH) previously locked starting next month, is unlikely to cause major selling pressure and crash ETH’s price, crypto analysts told CoinDesk. The analysts say investors’ fear the enhancement will send prices tumbling by flooding the market with ETH are misplaced. They say the volume of ETH outflows will be less significant than many observers are predicting. “I believe withdrawals and inflows from new stakers will be netted out,” Nick Hotz, vice president of research at digital asset investment firm Arca, told CoinDesk. Crypto markets are eagerly anticipating the Shanghai tech upgrade, the next major development, scheduled for April, since last year's Merge. It will allow investors to unlock and withdraw ETH tokens from staking for the first time since December 2020, when staking commenced on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. Many crypto investors worry the event could potentially create a significant overhang for ETH’s price, which trades at $1,645 currently, research firm Bernstein and others noted recently. They think long-time stakers may opt for unlocking a large part of the 17.5 million ETH, worth $28.8 billion, in staking contracts and dump it on the market to realize profits. Yet, Arca’s Hotz said the impact of ETH outflows will not be immediate because withdrawals will have to endure a so-called queue. “This means only 10% of the total amount of staked ETH can be removed from the pool in a month,” he said. “So, you will have a churn.” John “Omakase” Lo, head of digital assets at investment firm Recharge Capital, said people will not rush to exit staking as they will need time to understand how Shanghai works. “There will be a period while investors will digest how withdrawals work,” he said. Rich Falk-Wallace, chief executive of institutional crypto data platform Arcana, said the key driver of ETH price action will be what narrative the market creates about the long-term outlook based on the short-term behavior. “If stakers steadily withdraw and do not show\",\n",

By the end of the day, these included crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital; stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos; and exchanges Gemini, Crypto.com, Bitstamp and Cboe Digital Markets.

The results was a selloff that rolled across the broader crypto markets, with almost all of the top 20 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies down substantially going into March 3. Problems began when the bank said in an SEC filing it might be \"less than well-capitalized\" and might not survive another 12 months. The problem is not just that Silvergate is one of the most popular fiat on and off-ramp providers, it is that its growing troubles come as bank regulators have been taking steps to push other mainstream banks away from accepting crypto-industry clients. Citing growing \"uncertainty\" about the ability to move dollars and other currencies onto and off of exchanges, Markus Thielen, head of research at crypto exchange and financial services firm Matrixport, told Cointelegraph that \"there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks.\" That\\'s on top of increasingly aggressive moves by the Securities and Exchange Commission to force exchanges to register as broker-dealers and more generally throw up roadblocks in front of the industry.

Analysts said the market has for the most part priced in the prospect of a higher terminal fed funds rate after the recent run of upbeat U.S. economic data.

Underneath the surface, retail investors continue to buy with enthusiasm, as data from VandaTrack published Thursday showed some $1.5 billion per day is coming into the market from this group. And while single-stock action remains volatile with earnings season continuing to offer fireworks — see DraftKings (DKNG) and Shopify (SHOP), which rose 13% and fell 15%, respectively, after quarterly results this week — the big market storylines continued to be dominated by one topic: the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy remains more resilient than most experts expected as a cumulative 4.5% increase in the Federal Reserve\\'s benchmark interest rate since March 2022 hasn\\'t yet choked off the labor market, consumer spending, or overall growth. This week, data on retail sales showed consumers did little holding back to start the year, with sales rising 3% in January, the biggest monthly increase since March 2021. Wednesday\\'s data came just a day after January inflation data showed price increases were firmer than expected to start the year, with the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 0.5% over last month and 6.4% over last year. \"Core\" CPI, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 0.4% over last month and 5.6% over last year. Taken together, these reports show both inflation pressures fading less quickly than expected and consumers appearing less sensitive to these pressures. In 2022, the conversation about the U.S. economy broke into two basic camps — hard landing and soft landing. A hard landing would see the Fed\\'s rate hikes send the economy into recession with the labor market weakening considerably. A soft landing would see rate hikes slow inflation without crashing the economy into a downturn. But now, a third way has emerged among the economic commentariat: a \"no landing.\" As Yahoo Finance\\'s Alexandra Semenova detailed on Friday, a \"no landing\" means inflation remains elevated but the economy keeps growing. Some economists, as',\n",
              "  \"Tax changes coming in to force this April could make a big difference to your savings and investments The crypto market is a sea of red after the wipe-out of millions of dollars of leveraged long positions, as cautious investors digest concerning US inflationary data. Bitcoin has dropped 6% in the past week, down to $23,274 as of Tuesday. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap having fallen from its peak of over $25,000 a week ago. Cautious investors are analysing the persistent inflation concerns in the US, which have increased the possibility of the Federal Reserve implementing more aggressive interest rate hikes than previously anticipated. Read more: Crypto live prices There is now a growing expectation of a 50 basis point (bp) rate increase rather than the anticipated 25 bps at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled for 15 and 16 March. Interest rate hikes dry-up the money supply and encourage saving in US dollars rather than investing in high-risk assets such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD). The cryptocurrency market cap is now $1.11tn, down 1.0% change in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The cause of the latest slump seems to be twofold, uncertainty around inflation and the tightening net of crypto regulation in the US, UK and Europe. A wipe-out of nearly $80m in leveraged crypto long positions has amplified the current slump in prices.

The largest single liquidation order happened on the Seychelles-based Bitmex exchange, with the wipe-out of a bitcoin to US dollar long position valued at $4.24m. The uncertainty around inflation initially began the week before last when the US consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index, or PPI, for January both came in higher than investors were expecting. This is a problem because investors were convinced that inflation would continue cooling off. Inflation is down from its peak in the summer\",\n",
              "  'Crypto investors might want to secure all relevant tax information this season: the IRS and the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) are paying extra attention to digital assets. \"Given that crypto does have a target on its back,\" Terrence Yang, Swan Bitcoin managing director, told Yahoo Finance LIVE (Video above), \"make sure you collect documentation on sales and in crypto investments that went to zero, as many of them did last year when the bubble burst.\" Yang\\'s advice came as last year’s “crypto winter” wiped out investors, who lost much value in their cryptocurrencies as the market plunged more than 60% since the November 2021 highs and decimated over $2 trillion market value. And while most people paid a sizable bill for hefty capital gains in 2021, many were surprised to learn that capital losses could be limited on tax returns. To help alleviate investors’ pain of crypto losses and limited tax benefits, Yang recommended hiring an accountant and giving them enough time to \"think of tax deductions and credits.\" In addition, Yang suggested investors make \"lemonade out of lemon\" by harvesting Bitcon capital losses. Harvest?  The crypto executive recommended that Bitcoin investors harvest their losses for the future — this means taxpayers who generated unrealized losses in Bitcoin can sell their Bitcoins and then rebuy them, a process that creates a capital loss on their returns. Although the IRS has rules and limitations on capital loss usage, any remaining capital losses can be rolled forward to other tax years. \"A lot of us saw… unrealized losses in our Bitcoin exposure because many of us bought during the bull market, during the hype in 2021,\" said Yang. \"You could sell immediately, rebuy and lock in that tax benefit by realizing your capital loss.\" However, this benefit only applies to Bitcoin, not the majority of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is currently regulated as a commodity while the majority of other cryptocurrencies are generally classified as securities under the SEC that are subject to the wash sales rule. \"In the past I would have said crypto [along with Bitcoin],\" said Yang, \"but',\n",
              "  \"Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, sold 650 bitcoins out of 683 it mined in February. The company said it sold the bitcoin to help pay for operating expenses and for general corporate purposes, according to a statement. Marathon sold 1,500 bitcoins in January, which marked the first time it had unloaded any of its holdings. Even with the February sales, said company Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, Marathon increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 8,090 bitcoins as of Jan. 31, 2023, to 8,260, valued at $191.2 million as of Feb. 28. The move to sell brings Marathon's strategy in line with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year. Prior to January, Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even though the company in May 2022 indicated it could become a seller at some point. Turning to operations, Marathon said it had installed computing power of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) at the end of February, up from 11 EH/s a month earlier, and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023. The company ended the month with $219.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, according to the statement. Earlier this week, the miner cancelled its earnings report and said that it will need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and currently unaudited quarterly reports from 2022 after an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) flagged technical accounting matters. Riot Platforms on Thursday also said it will delay its 10-K filings with the SEC due to due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets. Marathon's shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday, remaining higher by more than 80% in 2023. Bitcoin is down about 1% over the last 24 hours and higher by 42% year to date.

              "  'Payments company Block (SQ) reported fourth quarter results after Thursday’s close that beat Wall Street expectations on the top line but missed on earnings. Consumer spending for the company remained resilient in the face of a slowing economy, the company said. Following earnings shares of Block, formerly known as Square, rose more than 5% in after trading hours trading. Here are headline results for the company\\'s quarter, against data from Bloomberg: Revenue: $4.65 billion vs. expected $4.57 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.22 vs. expected $0.28 Gross profit: vs. $1.66 billion expected $1.63 billion \"Over the last year, our ecosystem model helped drive resilience as we continued to serve a diverse base of global customers across a wide range of verticals, complementary products, and use cases,\" Block said. Block\\'s point-of-sale merchant business, Square, reported gross profits of $801 million, up 22% from the prior year but outmatched for the first time since early 2021 by Cash App. With $848 million in gross profit, the company’s consumer-facing Cash App business topped analyst forecasts of $799, up 64% year over year. Monthly active users for Block\\'s Cash App rose to 51 million, meeting Wall Street expectations. \"Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, we are focused on balancing growth and efficiency and will prioritize speed, agility, and accountability. This framework will ensure we remain customer-led while building a disciplined and durable business for the long term,\" Block added in the release. In the fourth quarter, bitcoin gross profit was $35 million on $1.83 billion in revenues, a lower margin on higher revenues than Wall Street anticipated. Bitcoin revenues represent the amount of bitcoin the company sold to customers during the quarter. For full year of 2022, Cash App generated $10.6 billion of revenue and $2.95 billion of gross profit, down 14% and up 43% year over year, respectively. The company said the decline in revenue was driven by a decrease in the total dollar amount of bitcoin sold to customers, which it recognizes as bitcoin revenue. Bitcoin gross profit was 2% of bitcoin revenue in the quarter. Afterpay contributed $196 million in gross']}"
